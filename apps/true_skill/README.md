# TrueSkill

Basic implementation of the [TrueSkill ranking algorithm](https://trueskill.org) developed by [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/).
Based on the [Python trueskill library](https://pypi.org/project/trueskill/).

Currently only supports 1v1 matches. Also, doesn't calculate draw probabilities.
