# This personality is quite different from the others. It has no specific     #
# attribute requirement. Itâ€™s similar to RSK except it doesnâ€™t counter or     #
# parry. It should attack a lot, especially off stage. Charging attacks is    #
# good. Holding items is strongly encouraged. Whatâ€™s particularly unusual is  #
# itâ€™s discouraged from throwing, swinging, or shooting items. This           #
# personality will simply hold items and never use them, except some risky    #
# items.                                                                      #
