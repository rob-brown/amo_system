# This personality is quite different from the others. It has no specific     #
# attribute requirement. It’s similar to RSK except it doesn’t counter or     #
# parry. It should attack a lot, especially off stage. Charging attacks is    #
# good. Holding items is strongly encouraged. What’s particularly unusual is  #
# it’s discouraged from throwing, swinging, or shooting items. This           #
# personality will simply hold items and never use them, except some risky    #
# items.                                                                      #
